Calculators I made for calculating grades for the Imperial College London Computer Science course.
- [First Year Calculator](https://erewhon.xyz/imperial/first_year_marks/)
- [Second Year Calculator](https://erewhon.xyz/imperial/second_year_marks/)

The second year marks one can probably be extended a lot more easily (i.e. for future course changes/third year onwards), but the primary issue is where to find all the information needed for it.

More information in the `second_year_marks/` directory.
